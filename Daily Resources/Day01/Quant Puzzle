# 🧠 Quant Puzzle – Day 1

## 📌 Topic: Magical Fruit Collision

### 🤔 What’s the Puzzle?

We have:

- 🍎 13 Apples  
- 🍌 15 Bananas  
- 🍒 17 Cherries  

All placed inside a **magic hat**. Whenever a *collision* occurs between two **different** fruits, both disappear and are replaced by **two of the third type**.

📌 Only these collisions are allowed:
- Apple + Banana → 2 Cherries  
- Banana + Cherry → 2 Apples  
- Cherry + Apple → 2 Bananas

> 🧙‍♂️ No other transformation is holy!

### ❓ Main Question

Can a sequence of such magical collisions lead to a final state where **all 45 fruits** are of **just one type**?

#### 🔄 Invariant Method:

Let’s define a function:


✅ This value stays constant through all valid collisions.

Initial value:

Now check each final state:
- f(45, 0, 0) = 0
- f(0, 45, 0) = 1
- f(0, 0, 45) = 2

Only `f(0,45,0) = 1` matches the invariant. So theoretically, **yes, all Bananas** *might* be possible.

But wait...

#### 🧮 System of Equations Method:

Let:
- A = # of times Apples are increased by 2  
- B = # of times Bananas are increased by 2  
- C = # of times Cherries are increased by 2

We derive the following equations from the transformation rules and need for 45 of one fruit:


Subtract the last two:


This equation has **no integer solution** ⇒ contradiction!  
So, reaching **all of one fruit** is **not possible**.

### 🛑 Final Answer: **No**, it's impossible.

### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- Invariants like `f(A,B,C) mod 3` help **prove impossibility** in transformation problems.
- Using algebraic constraints ensures no overlooked cases.
- These puzzles are great practice for **reasoning, modular arithmetic, and logic** — crucial in quant interviews.
